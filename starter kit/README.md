*Matlab Scripts for gm/ID Lookup-Table Generation (Standalone Starter Kit)*

The scripts provided in this repo store DC-sweep simulation data into Matlab files (.mat). These “lookup tables” can then be used for systematic circuit design in Matlab, as described in our book. The book’s companion website provides Matlab scripts for the design examples of each chapter, lookup tables for a 65-nm process, and a “lookup” function (also contained in this repo) for read-in and data interpolation. The scripts provided in this repo are for those who want to generate their own lookup tables. Please refer to Appendix 2 of our book for a more detailed description of the lookup table generation flow (summarized in the figure below).
